## Project Development and Planning 

This website was planned and developed using principles of User Experience (UX) design, which include the five planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. Using these principles, the aim was to create a fun, easy-to-use, responsive and engaging quiz website to entertain users who are interested in learning more about their personalities. 

### Project Goals 

#### Project Purpose

- The Supervillain Quiz website is an interactive quiz designed to entertain users of all ages and backgrounds who want to learn more about the different sides of their personality, particularly those interested in superheroes and supervillains. 
- It provides the user with thought-provoking questions and scenarios relating to the dark side of their personalities, which will eventually lead them to identify with a famous supervillain. 
- The website was designed to be easy-to-navigate and eye-catching, to provide the users with an interactive, exciting quiz to teach them more about themselves and what they would do in certain situations. 
- Users will be able to respond to 10 questions, each with 5 answer options, and will only be able to select the one that is most suited to their personality. 
- Users can also sign up with their name, email/username and password, and later login with the same details should they choose to revisit the website. 

#### Target Audience

- The Supervillain Quiz website is designed for users of any background or age, but will most like gain more interest from audiences who are interested in Disney, Marvel or DC superheroes and supervillains.
- The simplicity of the website makes it easy for adults, teenagers and even children to take and retake the quiz as many times as they want, and access the results each time. 

#### User Goals 
- To have a professional, bold and inviting appearance, to encourage users to take part in the quiz. 
- To give users the opportunity to Sign Up easily and safely using a simple, secure sign up form. 
- To ensure that users can Log In easily using the same email/username and password if they revisit the website to retake the quiz. 
- To ensure that users can answer each question in the quiz smoothly, and retake it as many times as they wish. 
- To change the order of the questions and generate new questions, so that if the user retakes the quiz, they will feel like they are taking a new quiz and may even get different results.
- To allow users to navigate between pages with ease, and to keep the design and colour palette consistent throughout. 

## Research 

### Market Review 

Before designing the website, I reviewed other personality quiz websites (see below), in order to get a feel of how they presented themselves, which content and features they offered, and the design choices they made in terms of colour palette. I also reviewed what appeared to work well for the user and what needed improvements. 

[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/gustorchi/we-can-legit-tell-which-super-villain-you-would-be-9iuf1y91vp) | [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) | [Playbuzz](https://www.playbuzz.com/quizzes/personality) | [The Superhero Quiz](https://www.thesuperheroquiz.com/villain/) | [Truity Big Five Personality Test](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)

### Key Takeaways from Market Review 

- The website should be eye-catching, to make users excited about taking the SuperVillain Quiz
- The Website should be clean, simple and easy to navigate
- The Quiz should not have too many questions (a maximum of 10 questions appears to be the ideal number to maintain the users' attention)
- Clear, enticing images of famous Supervillains are key features to draw in the users to take part in the quiz
- Navigation, sign up and login elements should be simple and quick to use 

## User Stories
- User Story 1: As someone interested in taking the SuperVillain personality quiz I want to:
     - find out what the quiz is about and what to expect before starting the quiz
     - navigate easily through the quiz questions 
     - have the option of retaking the quiz if I don't like the result
     - learn more about why I was matched with a specific SuperVillain at the end of the quiz
     - sign up quickly and easily
     - log in using the same login details quickly and easily
     - navigate easily between pages

- User Story 3: As a :

These user stories gave me a clear scope for the website and enabled me to stay on track with the project, preventing issues like scope creep at a later stage after the coding process. 

## Design, Layout and Structure 
The design, layout and structure remained consistent across all pages for certain elements, such as the colour palette for the headings, paragraphs and backgrounds and the design of the navigation bar. However, the layout of each page was slightly different, to allow users to differentiate between the Sign Up/Log In pages and the Quiz and Results pages. On each page, a lot of visual content, such as eye-catching images, bold colours and buttons were incorporated.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled me to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style.
